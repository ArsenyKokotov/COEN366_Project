Server communication
- python client and server
- json data exchange format
- represent the fundamental parts of the protocol as classes/objects in python (each kind of message, a client class, a server class, etc)
- Design for LAN only (so only need to keep track of LAN IPs)
- No auth / GUI (the bonus marks) 
The server needs to keep track of the client data persistently so idk maybe an sqlite db or some other DB (maybe nosql of some kind since there is some variability in data stored for each client)
